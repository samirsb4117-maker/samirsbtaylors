    <h2>A Page of My Life in Taylor's University</h2>
    <p>Each morning for which day I have my classes, I start my day early for my morning classes with a butter toast and a bottle of water prepared 
        as I head out early to my campus, having to face the daily morning traffic jam at Federal Highway. I then go about my day as per usual. 
        I usually head back home immediately after my class ends and have my lunch at home. Other times, I would have my lunch in campus.
        While the campus has various food options within its compound, I prefer having food close to my home since it is cheaper in comparison.
        </p>

    <p>I have various interests that keep me occupied when I have free time. Among them is reading. I mostly read historical and scientific books
        but I also dabble in fiction and non-fiction books. I also draw digitally and traditionally, through Procreate and my sketchbook respectively.
        I have three cats that my family owns, so I spend some time playing and caring for them too. Aside from that, I mostly go about my day doing
        chores and assignments.
